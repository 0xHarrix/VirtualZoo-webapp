            <p class="detailsPageEarth"><strong>Earth, our home! </strong>is a wondrous and diverse place teeming with life. Nestled in the vastness of space, it is the only known celestial body that supports life as we know it. From the majestic mountains to the shimmering oceans, Earth showcases a breathtaking array of landscapes and ecosystems. It is adorned with lush forests, expansive deserts, cascading waterfalls, and vibrant coral reefs. As the third planet from the Sun, Earth enjoys the perfect conditions for sustaining life, with a delicate balance of atmospheric composition, moderate temperatures, and the presence of water. This blue gem is not only our habitat but also a source of inspiration, wonder, and a reminder of the interconnectedness of all living beings. It is our responsibility to protect and preserve this precious planet for future generations to come.</p>

            <p class="detailsPageMoon"><strong>The Moon, Earth's faithful companion,</strong> has captivated human imagination for centuries. As Earth's only natural satellite, the Moon is a familiar presence in our night sky. Its serene and silvery glow has inspired poets, artists, and dreamers throughout history. The Moon is a barren and desolate world, devoid of life and an atmosphere. Its surface is marked by vast craters, rugged mountains, and ancient lava plains. Lunar exploration has revealed its secrets, from the Moon's regolith, or surface soil, to its extreme temperature variations. The Moon's gravitational pull influences our tides and has even played a role in shaping Earth's ecosystems. It serves as a testament to human ingenuity, as humans have left footprints on its dusty terrain during historic missions. The Moon continues to intrigue and beckon us, reminding us of the boundless possibilities that lie beyond our home planet.</p>

            <h1 class="headingSun">Sun</h1>
            <p class="detailsPageSun"><strong>The Sun, our radiant and life-giving star,</strong> is the center of our solar system. It illuminates our world with its brilliant light and provides the energy necessary for all forms of life on Earth. The Sun is an enormous, glowing ball of hot plasma, composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. It emits a continuous stream of light and heat, which travels through space and reaches our planet. Its immense gravitational pull keeps our planet and other celestial bodies in orbit. The Sun's energy powers the Earth's weather systems, drives photosynthesis in plants, and is harnessed as a source of renewable energy. Its dazzling presence during the day and the stunning sunrises and sunsets it paints across the sky remind us of the vastness and beauty of the universe. The Sun is a celestial marvel that sustains life and fills our world with warmth and brightness.</p>

            <h1 class="headingSolarSystem">Solar System</h1>
            <p class="detailsPageSolarSystem"><strong>The Solar System </strong>is a captivating and intricate cosmic neighborhood that we call home. It comprises the Sun, eight planets, numerous moons, asteroids, comets, and other celestial objects. At the center of it all, the Sun shines brightly, providing light and heat to its planetary companions. Starting from the closest planet to the Sun, we have Mercury, a small and rocky world, followed by Venus, Earth, and Marsâ€”each with its own unique characteristics. Beyond Mars, lies the realm of gas giants: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, which boast mesmerizing rings, swirling storms, and intriguing moons. The Solar System is also adorned with numerous moons, such as Earth's Moon and Jupiter's Galilean moons, offering a diversity of landscapes and geological wonders. As we explore the far reaches of our Solar System, we encounter icy worlds like Pluto and Kuiper Belt objects, revealing the vastness of our cosmic surroundings. Studying the Solar System allows us to unravel the mysteries of our origins, understand the conditions for life, and contemplate our place in the grand tapestry of the universe.</p>

            <h1 class="headingBlackHole">Black Holes</h1>
            <p class="detailsPageBlackHole"><strong>Black holes are enigmatic and powerful cosmic phenomena</strong> that defy our conventional understanding of space and time. Formed from the remnants of massive stars that have undergone gravitational collapse, black holes possess an extraordinary gravitational pull that is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape their grasp. They are regions of spacetime where gravity becomes infinitely strong, leading to a singularity, a point of infinite density at their core. Black holes come in different sizes, from stellar black holes that are a few times more massive than our Sun to supermassive black holes that reside at the centers of galaxies, containing millions or billions of solar masses. Despite their name, black holes do not appear as empty voids, but rather, they are surrounded by an event horizon, an invisible boundary beyond which nothing can return. These celestial entities continue to captivate scientists and inspire groundbreaking research as we strive to unravel the mysteries they hold and deepen our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe.</p>

            <p class="detailsPageGalaxy"><strong>The Milky Way galaxy is a breathtaking tapestry of stars, planets, and cosmic wonders</strong> that spans across the vastness of space. It is our celestial home, a spiral galaxy containing billions of stars, including our Sun. From our vantage point within the Milky Way, we observe a band of shimmering light that arcs across the night sky, known as the Milky Way itself. This magnificent galaxy is filled with a myriad of stellar objects, such as nebulae, star clusters, and pulsars. Its spiral arms spiral outwards, adorned with gas, dust, and young stars, while the galactic center hosts a supermassive black hole, which influences the motions of the surrounding stars. The Milky Way galaxy serves as a reminder of the sheer scale and beauty of the universe, inviting us to contemplate the mysteries that lie beyond our own celestial neighborhood.</p>
